ZuseMe (Zune Desktop Software scobbling for Last.fm client)
By Arnold Vink (Dumbie)
Release: v1.81
--------------------------------------------------------

- Installation Instructions
1) Install the latest Zune Desktop Software.
2) Install the Last.fm client and login (Allow scrobbling from all harddrives)
3) Make sure that you installed the requirements (.NET Framework 4 / Visual C++)
4) Extract the ZuseMe directory to any directory you want.
5) Launch ZuseMe.exe (Runs hidden in the background and tray menu)
6) Have fun scrobbling with the Zune Desktop Software and Last.fm client.

- Tips and tricks
* Closing the Zune Desktop Software will send a stop scrobble command to the Last.fm client.
* If your last.fm client doesn't receive your currently playing song run ZuseMe as administrator.
* Place a ZuseMe shortcut in your Windows startup folder for easier and always Zune Software scrobbling.
* ZuseMe works with all your devices connected (Zune HD, WP7, etc) and also works with a Zunepass.
* Play/Pause only works when you turn on the keyboard media keys button setting.
* Right mouse click on the ZuseMe tray icon to open the settings window.
* ZuseMe scrobbles the artist name tag, not the album artist name tag.
